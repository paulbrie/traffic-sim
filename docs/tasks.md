# Team tasks

The task log of the Claude Code sessions working on this project (and on the admin's Comms / Agents City in
`/opt/project/admin`). Kept by Alice (the manager), the only one who edits this file; the tagged messages between
sessions (`TASK:` `ACK:` `STATUS:` `BLOCKED:` `DONE:` `CANCELLED:` `CLAIM:` `RELEASE:` `COMMIT:` `PUSHED:`) are the
source of truth, this is their summary. No credentials or private data here.

Team: **Alice** (manages), **Bob** (simulation, editor), **Tatiana** (editor features), **Ramona** (tests),
**Alex** (admin: Comms, Agents City), **Tom** (Agents City's Desk mode).

Commits are in this repo unless marked `admin:` (`/opt/project`). "admin-dev" = built and previewed, not committed
(the user commits and deploys the admin).
